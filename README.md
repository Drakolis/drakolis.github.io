# Work With Me
## What I Do

I solve high-level, complex challenges that haven’t been done before—across systems, products, and strategy. I’m at my best when I’m shaping something new, not optimizing what already exists.

I think in patterns, not tasks. I zoom out. I connect dots others miss. Whether I’m leading a team, prototyping a system, or creating new user experiences, my focus is always the same: build something meaningful, elegant, and scalable.

## How I Work Best
- Give me a wide problem space and trust—watch it turn into vision and architecture.
- I love teams who care. About the mission, about each other, about why we're doing the work.
- I bring a strong sense of creative ownership, but I collaborate deeply—no heroics, no ego.
- Balance is not optional. Burnout kills creativity. Healthy people build better systems.

## I’m Not For...
- Environments that fear change more than mediocrity.
- Roles where “innovation” means copying last decade’s ideas.
- Teams that care more about “clocking in” than solving meaningful challenges.

## My Principles
- Human-first design, always. Tech, systems, work culture—it all starts with people.
- Creativity needs boundaries. You can’t sustain great work if you’re always on fire.
- Impact > Optics. Button colours are not a strategy.
- Play is serious. The best ideas come from exploration, not just execution.

## What I’m Looking For
- Big, unsolved, system level problems. Not in theory—in practice.
- Teams who want to build better, not just more.
- Leaders who get that doing something truly new means trust, space, and intention.
