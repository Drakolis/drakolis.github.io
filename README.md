# Work With Me
## Who am I
Hi, I am Mika — the Technical Systems Architect and Product Chaos Stabilizer you have been looking for. With 10+ years across startups and scale-ups, I lead with depth, design for resilience, and coach people into their best. If you’re building something that doesn’t have a name yet, I’m the one who helps it take form.

## What I Do
I help visionary teams turn ambiguity into architecture. Whether it’s an undefined product, a chaotic system, or a team without direction, I step in where clarity is missing and build what’s needed — code, systems, or mindsets.

I build what others can’t yet see. I specialize in bringing vision into resilient systems. I am also good at coaching high-performing teams, and stabilizing chaos at critical moments. Whether the stage of the company is, I show up as a systems architect, strategic translator, and builder of the previously unbuildable.

I think in patterns, not tasks. I zoom out. I connect dots others miss. My focus is always the same: build something meaningful, elegant, and scalable.

## How I Work Best
- Give me a wide problem space and trust — watch it turn into vision and architecture.
- I love teams who care. About the mission, about each other, about why we're doing the work.
- I bring a strong sense of creative ownership, but I collaborate deeply — no heroics, no ego.
- Balance is non-negotiable. Burnout kills creativity. Healthy people build better systems.

## I’m Not For...
- Environments that fear change more than mediocrity.
- Roles where “innovation” means copying last decade’s ideas.
- Teams that care more about “clocking in” than solving meaningful challenges.
- Maintaining things with low returns. Let's focus on features that will are bringing results.

## My Principles
- Human-first design, always. Tech, systems, work culture — it all starts with people.
- Creativity needs freedom. You can’t sustain great work if you’re always on fire.
- Technical excellence, for real. Ensure quality starts from design to implementation and up to active use.
- Impact of the work matters. Changing button colours is not a strategy.
- Play is serious. The best ideas come from exploration, not just execution.

## What I’m Looking For
- Big, unsolved, system-level problems. Not in theory — in practice.
- Teams who want to build better, not just more.
- Leaders who get that doing something truly new means trust, space, and intention.
